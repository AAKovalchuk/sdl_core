How to build the avatar project for iOS

Used software:
- Xcode 4.6.2 (4H1003) and iOS SDK 6.1 from the Mac App Store or
  https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

The following tools are used to compress JS&CSS files (the compressors are
available in the archive):
- Java Runtime Environment 1.6.0_37 (http://java.oracle.com/)
- Closure Compiler 20120710 (revision 2079) from
  http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/
- YUI Compressor 2.4.7 from http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/

Preparations:
1. Make sure JRE is installed, for JS&CSS compressing.

There are multiple localizations of the app: English, French, and Spanish. For
each one there are three build schemes: regular (debug), adhoc, and release.
Therefore, in the build process below you should select the version you need:
avatar/avatar-french/avatar-spanish, avatar_adhoc/avatar_adhoc-french/
avatar_adhoc-spanish, or avatar_release/avatar_release-french/
avatar_release-spanish.

Build process:
1. Open `native/ios/src/avatar.xcworkspace` workspace in Xcode.
2. To prepare a release build for AppStore, select the avatar_release scheme >
   iOS Device, the Product > Archive. After a while, the Organizer - Archives
   window should open. Select the latest built archive, click Distributeâ€¦
   button, select Submit to the iOS App Store. Follow the guide.

The build process in Xcode builds all the required dependencies automatically.
