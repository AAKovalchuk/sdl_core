Privacy

This App does not collect personally identifiable information about you.  All information is free to browse at your leisure without the need for you to provide any personally identifiable information.  The App collects other information, non-personally identifiable information from users.  This means that we do not track these items on an individual
basis that identifies the App user, but rather gather and collect this information on an aggregate [or anonymous] basis that includes all App users.  Our primary goal in collecting aggregate information is to be able to perform metrics that allow us to improve the functionality of the App. We need to collect aggregate information in order to track pages visits and peak usage times, and to perform click through analysis and layout re-design. When a user downloads the App and subscribes to Push Notifications, Ford obtains a unique identification number (”ID”).  The ID is required to
enable Ford to send the user the content to which they subscribed via a Push Notification.   Ford is unable to identify the user or the mobile device from the ID numbers.  Ford does not collect personal information from the user’s
mobile device.
