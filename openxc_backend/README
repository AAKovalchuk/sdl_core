Dependency libraries (need to install first and check their successfull installation):
- python 2.7
- pip (http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)
- openxc (http://python.openxcplatform.com/en/latest/installation.html)

1. It is necessary to have appropriate firmware for the OpenXC (the one Chris creates with the name "vi-firmware-FORDBOARD-radiocontrols-20-11-13.bin")

2. Once OpenXC connected to the USB need to be sure that all data transferring well (cammand "openxc-dump" http://python.openxcplatform.com/en/latest/tools/dump.html)
   Be sure that only one connection with OpenXC via USB exists! (after successfull command line test close all terminals)

3. Run Server.py with next parameter:
   PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python ~/<path_to_file>/Server.py
   
   To be sure that OpenXC server works navigate to "openxc_backend/web_console" and run index.html
   You should see "Server status:" panel at the left side and "Dump:" panel at rigth side with a data flow.
   If there are no data flow, please be sure that at the terminal window where server was launched there are no errors (is there are errors - restart server)
   
   When server run with success please press "Stop" and close index.html page (as pointed in N2 it occupies connection)

4. When HMI simulator run it automatically create connection to the server
